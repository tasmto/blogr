          "<h2>You're Not Curating Your Projects</h2><p>It's tempting to dump every project you've ever touched in your portfolio to make it feel full and impressive, but that only drags your better work down. Instead of filling your portfolio with fluff, choose only the projects that make you proud. Curate and let your best work shine.<br/><br/>When a recruiter or senior designer is reviewing dozens or even hundreds of portfolios a week, you can imagine they don't spend much time on any one of them. The first 2-3 seconds on your page count the most. In those 2-3 seconds they will decide if they jump to the next portfolio or stay a bit longer and browse your work. Optimizing your overview and curating your projects can mean the difference between getting that closer look, or getting dismissed within seconds.</p>",

          "<h2>You're Not Selling Yourself (in Addition to Your Work) Enough</h2><p>With our portfolio, we tend to assume our work will speak for itself. But it's not just about your work, it's about you. Your potential employers or clients want to know who you are: How you think, what it would be like working with you, whether you work well with a team. Sometimes, that's even more important than your experience and skill.<br/><br/>These are all qualities you can convey in your About page and project case studies.<br/>Your About page is the most important page on your portfolio. Most people's first instinct is to navigate to this page to get some idea of who you are before they browse your work. Of course you should include your name and email address on your About page, but don't be afraid to show some personality here too. Add a photo of you at work. If you're funny, crack a joke. Regardless of whether you're funny, write in your voice and be yourself. Your About page should make readers feel like they've had a quick lunch with you. It should be brief, pleasant and memorable.<br/><br/>Case studies not only provide context for your projects (which is crucial), but also give the reader a glimpse into both your thought process and personality. Write brief but insightful case studies that let the reader know how you approached a project, your thought process along the way and your feelings about the final result. Sell both your work and yourself..</p>",

          '<h2>Development</h2><p>Brennan Lee Mulligan said he was inspired to set Exandria Unlimited: Calamity in the Age of Arcanum following a dinner conversation he had with Matt Mercer in 2021. Mulligan stated that Mercer was a generous resource "during the conception and prep-work" for the series and that Mercer "was also excited for Mulligan to flesh out and expand on a period of Exandrian history that Mercer had only imagined in broader terms".[9] On setting the series in the Age of Arcanum, Mulligan compared it to the Arthur C. Clarke quote on magic and technology being indistinguishable past a certain point. Mulligan said, "people will see some similarities that exist between our world and the Age of Arcanum in terms of an accessibility of magic that is so promulgated that it just seeps into the workings of everyday life in a way that is not present in current day Exandria. That is something that was truly lost".[10]<br/><br/>On setting Exandria Unlimited: Calamity during an apocalypse, Mulligan said, "If your only question is \'does the Calamity happen or not?\' that\'s a different series. The question here is \'What is the nature of mortal beings when faced with this?\' [...] There are different — and, in my opinion, more interesting — questions to be answered here than \'does the doom come or no?\'".[9]</p>',

          '<h2>Character creation</h2><p>Unlike typical Critical Role campaigns, where characters are developed separately by the players, the cast of Exandria Unlimited: Calamity developed their characters together as a group.[11] Marisha Ray said, "We entered this knowing that we are playing in the Age of Arcanum, so we knew we were playing high-level characters in very high positions of power. Brennan wanted us to be very powerful out of the gate, with characters who are in control and are movers and shakers. So, that required a lot of history, and lore, and understanding our positions before we even got started. One of the first things that we did when making our characters was just sit around a table together and talk about our relationships, and how each of us as individuals fit into the power structure of the city we live in".[11]<br/><br/>On creating characters in the Age of Arcanum, Sam Riegel said, "What was the government? Why was magic so popular? So to develop a character for that, not really knowing the world that you\'re in, is hard. It was a more fruitful process making the characters together. [...] But since Exandria Unlimited: Calamity is such a contained story in such a strange place and a strange time, it made a lot more sense to build the characters together. And we got some cool relationships out of it".</p>',
