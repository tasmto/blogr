          "<h2>You're Not Curating Your Projects</h2><p>It's tempting to dump every project you've ever touched in your portfolio to make it feel full and impressive, but that only drags your better work down. Instead of filling your portfolio with fluff, choose only the projects that make you proud. Curate and let your best work shine.<br/><br/>When a recruiter or senior designer is reviewing dozens or even hundreds of portfolios a week, you can imagine they don't spend much time on any one of them. The first 2-3 seconds on your page count the most. In those 2-3 seconds they will decide if they jump to the next portfolio or stay a bit longer and browse your work. Optimizing your overview and curating your projects can mean the difference between getting that closer look, or getting dismissed within seconds.</p>",

          "<h2>You're Not Selling Yourself (in Addition to Your Work) Enough</h2><p>With our portfolio, we tend to assume our work will speak for itself. But it's not just about your work, it's about you. Your potential employers or clients want to know who you are: How you think, what it would be like working with you, whether you work well with a team. Sometimes, that's even more important than your experience and skill.<br/><br/>These are all qualities you can convey in your About page and project case studies.<br/>Your About page is the most important page on your portfolio. Most people's first instinct is to navigate to this page to get some idea of who you are before they browse your work. Of course you should include your name and email address on your About page, but don't be afraid to show some personality here too. Add a photo of you at work. If you're funny, crack a joke. Regardless of whether you're funny, write in your voice and be yourself. Your About page should make readers feel like they've had a quick lunch with you. It should be brief, pleasant and memorable.<br/><br/>Case studies not only provide context for your projects (which is crucial), but also give the reader a glimpse into both your thought process and personality. Write brief but insightful case studies that let the reader know how you approached a project, your thought process along the way and your feelings about the final result. Sell both your work and yourself..</p>",

          '<h2>Development</h2><p>Brennan Lee Mulligan said he was inspired to set Exandria Unlimited: Calamity in the Age of Arcanum following a dinner conversation he had with Matt Mercer in 2021. Mulligan stated that Mercer was a generous resource "during the conception and prep-work" for the series and that Mercer "was also excited for Mulligan to flesh out and expand on a period of Exandrian history that Mercer had only imagined in broader terms".[9] On setting the series in the Age of Arcanum, Mulligan compared it to the Arthur C. Clarke quote on magic and technology being indistinguishable past a certain point. Mulligan said, "people will see some similarities that exist between our world and the Age of Arcanum in terms of an accessibility of magic that is so promulgated that it just seeps into the workings of everyday life in a way that is not present in current day Exandria. That is something that was truly lost".[10]<br/><br/>On setting Exandria Unlimited: Calamity during an apocalypse, Mulligan said, "If your only question is \'does the Calamity happen or not?\' that\'s a different series. The question here is \'What is the nature of mortal beings when faced with this?\' [...] There are different — and, in my opinion, more interesting — questions to be answered here than \'does the doom come or no?\'".[9]</p>',

          '<h2>Character creation</h2><p>Unlike typical Critical Role campaigns, where characters are developed separately by the players, the cast of Exandria Unlimited: Calamity developed their characters together as a group.[11] Marisha Ray said, "We entered this knowing that we are playing in the Age of Arcanum, so we knew we were playing high-level characters in very high positions of power. Brennan wanted us to be very powerful out of the gate, with characters who are in control and are movers and shakers. So, that required a lot of history, and lore, and understanding our positions before we even got started. One of the first things that we did when making our characters was just sit around a table together and talk about our relationships, and how each of us as individuals fit into the power structure of the city we live in".[11]<br/><br/>On creating characters in the Age of Arcanum, Sam Riegel said, "What was the government? Why was magic so popular? So to develop a character for that, not really knowing the world that you\'re in, is hard. It was a more fruitful process making the characters together. [...] But since Exandria Unlimited: Calamity is such a contained story in such a strange place and a strange time, it made a lot more sense to build the characters together. And we got some cool relationships out of it".</p>',

          "<h2>How to Stop Procrastinating With the “2-Minute Rule”</h2><p>The Two-Minute Rule states “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”<br/><br/>You'll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute version:<ul><li>“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”</li><li>“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”</li><li>“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”</li><li>“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”</li><li>“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”</li></ul>The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away. And, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once you've started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path.<br/><br/>You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to “very hard.” For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is hard. Walking ten thousand steps is moderately difficult. Walking ten minutes is easy. And putting on your running shoes is very easy. Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your running shoes. That's how you follow the Two-Minute Rule.</p>",

          '<h2>Why the Two-Minute Rule Works</h2><p>People often think it\'s weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can\'t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to <a href="https://jamesclear.com/optimal">standardize before you can optimize</a>.</p><p>As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely a hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you <a href="https://jamesclear.com/how-to-get-motivated">ritualize the beginning of a process</a>, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak performance. By following the same creative ritual, you make it easier to get into the hard work of creating. By developing a consistent power-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night.<a href="#" class="footnote-button" name="note-2-5152" data-footnote-number="2" data-footnote-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote 2" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>Author Cal Newport uses a shutdown ritual in which he does a last email inbox check, prepares his to-do list for the next day, and says “shutdown complete” to end work for the day.

You know that the real goal is to do more than just two minutes, so it may feel like you\'re trying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually aspiring to read one page or do one push-up or open their notes. And if you know it\'s a mental trick, why would you fall for it?</p><p>If the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes and then stop. Go for a run, but you must stop after two minutes. Start meditating, but you must stop after two minutes. Study Arabic, but you must stop after two minutes. It\'s not a strategy for starting, it\'s the whole thing. Your habit can only last one hundred and twenty seconds.</p><p><em>This article is an excerpt from Chapter 13 of my New York Times bestselling book&nbsp;Atomic&nbsp;Habits.&nbsp;<a title="Read more here" href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Read more here</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>',

We have experienced, as the name suggests, great amounts of love with intense bouts of anxiety to bring us down to reality.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Despite the fact that there is an underlying darkness in this album, it brings you to the sunnier times, the warmer times where potentially things didn&rsquo;t feel as intense. The 32 minutes of this album are light, enjoyable and each song has the ability to stop you in your tracks to listen the combination of exciting sounds.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The lead single &lsquo;sticky&rsquo; is fun and as the title highlights, it&rsquo;s so sticky that it definitely gets stuck in your head with the rhythmic, light yet gritty, guitar track. The guitar sound and production throughout this album is consistent and clearly each detail has been well thought of because each song is a puzzle piece.&nbsp;<br/><br/>John O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s vocals allude to Matty Healy&rsquo;s vocals from The 1975 and it&rsquo;s like a game of &lsquo;spot the 1975 influence&rsquo; throughout this album because as one listens, it shifts back into 2014 where the 1975&rsquo;s album was everywhere. It&rsquo;s questionable whether this is a deliberate ode to the British band, however, the British indie influence is definitely seeping in and lurking into the tracks.&nbsp;</p>',

When she and her friend Vanessa (Olivia Olson) are rocketed accidentally to an alien planet and Candace is dubbed "The Chosen One," she feels she\'s finally found a place where she\'s justly valued. But, of course, all is not as it seems. Thankfully, her inventive brothers, Phineas (Vincent Martella) and Ferb (David Errigo Jr.), and their gang of misfit friends are fast on her trail and intent on saving her. Vanessa\'s dad, the ever meddling Dr. Doofenshmirtz (voiced by Dan Povenmire, co-creator of the series with Jeff "Swampy" Marsh) and -- unbeknownst to all -- secret agent Perry the Platypus (Dee Bradley Baker) are along for the ride.</p>',

Their wordplay, imaginative adventures, misfit kid group, science-y themes, clever dialogues, exaggerated sibling rivalries, and, best of all, the day-saving double-agent pet platypus Perry are all just huge fun and downright lovable. Some of the musical numbers in <em>Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe</em> are also laugh-out-loud funny, and there's a clever sequence where the cartoon's creators appear as part of a reversing of the animation.</p><p>Other riffs may fly over younger kids' heads, like a seeming jab at Alexa-style voice recognition technology and those, like Trekkies, who find life lessons in long-running shows. An alien does the floss dance, something no adult has ever done well. Candace and her new alien BFF share a song-worthy girls' day, and both reach a new level of self-awareness from a few probing questions. As usual, the action is frenetically fast-paced. So, parents: Strap yourselves in and enjoy the ride alongside your kids.</p>",
